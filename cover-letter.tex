\opening{To Whom It May Concern:} 
I have a strong passion for taking problems and designing clean, elegant systems to solve them.\\ 
I see that your team is currently working on developing a microservice architecture and I believe that the modular approach is almost always the best route. In my personal projects I prefer to build small Node.js services that can be scaled invidually to meet demand. Even on a one-man team, the modularity allows quicker development time and makes it easier to add features. \\
My professional experience is centered around integrating disparate systems in an effient matter and the skills I've learned would be very valuable on a team that works with microservices. I would love to bring what I have to the table at TicketCity. 

\closing{
   Yours Sincerely\\
