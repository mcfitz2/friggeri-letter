\opening{To Whom It May Concern:} 
I am a software engineer with extensive knowledge of Python and HTML/JS/CSS. I have professional experience using with relational databases and Linux systems to integrate disparate systems. Coming up with creative solutions to problems is what I am passionate about and I strive to write clean, elegant code. 
    
    Last month, I attended a VMware recruiting event and was very impressed with what I learned about the culture at VMware. People at VMware are the best at what they do and everyone is committed to innovation. I would be thrilled to be a part of a company that supports this drive for high quality innovative products. 
    
    As an IX Tools Engineer, I'll use my skills to build systems that make the lives of customers and content managers easier. I look forward to meeting so I can explain how I can be a great asset for VMware. I am available for an interview whenever is convenient for you.
