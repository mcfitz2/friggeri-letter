\opening{To Whom It May Concern:} 
I'm a software developer with extensive knowledge of Python and HTML/JS/CSS and hands-on experience in technical and customer support. Integration is one of my specialties and I've worked on many projects both professionally and personally to make systems work together. 

    As a Customer Experience Engineer, I'll use my techical skills and support experience to create tools that make solving problems easy. I look forward to meeting so I can explain how I can be a great asset for Dropbox.
